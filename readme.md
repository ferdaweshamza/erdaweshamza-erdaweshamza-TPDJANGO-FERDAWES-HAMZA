Here's an improved version of the explanation for each command:

1. **`cd backend`**: Change the current directory to the `backend` folder, where your Django project files are located.
2. **`cd env/Scripts`**: Navigate to the `Scripts` directory within the virtual environment to access environment-specific scripts.
3. **`activate`**: Activate the virtual environment to isolate project dependencies and ensure the correct Python version is used.
4. **`pip install cryptography`**: Install the `cryptography` library, which is used for handling encryption and decryption in your Django project.
5. **`python manage.py runserver 8000`**: Start the Django development server on port 8000, making your project accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
6. **`python manage.py migrate`**: Apply any pending database migrations, updating the database schema to match the latest models.
7. **`python manage.py makemigrations tutorials`**: Generate migration files for the `tutorials` app based on changes in its models.

This improves clarity by explaining what each command does in the context of Django development.
